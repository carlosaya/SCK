*All staff have completed early childhood education, including child development, child psychology, teaching strategies and observation skills.*

Our experienced Early Childhood Teachers are supported by fully qualified assistants, in order to maximise learning opportunities and to provide a supportive and nurturing environment.

The ongoing professional development of all staff members is encouraged by the Kindergarten, through regular attendance at workshops, courses, conferences and online learning.
