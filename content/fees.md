_Fees are due no later than 2:30pm on Friday of week 2 in each term._

The Queensland Government subsidises part of the cost of every eligible child, and the remainder is paid in fees.  Additional funds are raised by the committee through fundraising and grants.

### Working Bees

Four working bees are held during the year, one in each term.  To receive the refund of your levy at the completion of the kindy year your family must complete three out of the four working bees, attending for a minimum of 2 hours at each of the three working bees.  If you are unable to attend a working bee then another job around the kindy deemed to be significant enough to replace the 2 hours at the working bee must be completed within the same term that the working bee was missed.  There are not always enough make-up jobs, so attending the working bees is the best option.

#### Refunds

If a family leaves during the kindy year, a full refund will be received if working bees/make-up jobs/rosters have been attended to date.
