Children bring with them a rich variety of cultural and social backgrounds and experiences. We recognise and appreciate the individuality of each child and family, and observe a policy of acceptance of race, creed, gender, disability, class or culture.
Children are encouraged to play, share and work alongside a consistent group of peers in a supportive and encouraging environment, which allows them to learn at their own pace.</description></item><item><title>Philosophy</title><link>https://www.samfordkindergarten.com.au/philosophy/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Mar 2018 06:19:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.samfordkindergarten.com.au/philosophy/</guid><description>Samford Community Kindergarten Philosophy The team at Samford Kindergarten believe that childhood is a unique time of life to be valued and enjoyed. Children develop their sense of belonging by celebrating the richness of the history of our Kindergarten, and the connections the centre has with community past, present and future.
Our semi-rural environment provides us with the unique opportunity to embrace country life with strong community involvement. We acknowledge that children come from diverse backgrounds and bring unique strengths, experiences and understanding of their world.</description></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>https://www.samfordkindergarten.com.au/contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.samfordkindergarten.com.au/contact/</guid><description>Samford Community Kindergarten Inc ABN 28 734 750 875
