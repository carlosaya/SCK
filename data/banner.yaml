title: It takes a village to raise a child
text: >
  Proudly helping generations of families since 1984, we at Samford Community
  Kindergarten believe that childhood is a unique time of life to be valued and
  enjoyed.<br>Children develop their sense of belonging by celebrating the
  richness of the history of the Kindergarten and the connections the centre has
  with the community. 

  Samford Community Kindergarten respectfully acknowledges the Traditional
  Custodians of the lands on which it stands and pays respects to all Elders
  past, present and future.
